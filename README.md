# Running the Main File

## Step 1: Set Up Docker Environment
Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. Use the provided Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) to set up the Kafka environment locally.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required Python dependencies using requirements.txt.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 3: Run the Main File Run the main Python file that orchestrates the execution of other scripts.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Step 4: Verify Output Monitor the console for any output or errors from the running scripts. Check the specified output directories for generated Avro files or any other expected output.

# Partitioning Strategy Justification

A good partitioning strategy is crucial for balancing load and achieving optimal performance in Kafka. For the transactions topic, partitioning by user_id is a logical choice due to the following reasons:

Load Balancing: Partitioning by user_id distributes the load evenly across partitions, especially if the number of unique user_ids is large and uniformly distributed.

Data Locality: Transactions for a specific user are stored in the same partition. This ensures that transactions for a particular user are processed in order, maintaining consistency in user balances and transactional integrity.

Parallelism: Partitioning by user_id enables concurrent processing of transactions for different users, improving overall throughput and performance.

# Backfilling Historical Data with TransactionsMLFeaturesJobConsumer

To backfill historical data using the TransactionsMLFeaturesJobConsumer service, we need to modify the existing implementation to support this use case. The backfill process involves reading all historical data, computing the total transactions count per user, and writing the results to Avro files without interacting with the Redis key-value store.

## Steps to Backfill Historical Data
Read Historical Data: Implement a method to read all historical messages from the Kafka topic. This may require setting the consumer to start from the earliest offset to ensure that all historical data is processed.

Process Historical Data: Aggregate the transaction counts for each user while processing the historical data. This step involves computing the total transactions count per user.

Write Results to Avro Files: Write the aggregated results to Avro files, similar to the current implementation. Each Avro file should contain the user_id and the corresponding total transactions count.

Avoid Redis: Ensure that during the backfill process, there is no interaction with the Redis key-value store. The focus should be solely on processing historical data and generating Avro files.

This modified implementation of the TransactionsMLFeaturesJobConsumer service allows for efficient backfilling of historical data without impacting the existing functionality or data stored in Redis.
